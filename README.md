ENERGY BIKE

Storage bike is a hypothetical start up bike share company that offers bikes with built in generators that generate power while the user is biking. This generated power is then added to the cities grid while the bike is at a station not in use. The companion app gives the user the ability to plan their route from each station while also tracking their amount of energy generated.  

The app is written in the JavaScript framework React Native and uses the additional libraries of Expo, Redux, React Native Navigation and React Native Maps. The app also uses the Google APIs Google Directions and Google Directions Matrix. The Directions API give the ability to plan the route between the users current location to the starting station as well as between the two desired stations. The Directions Matrix API gives the ability to determine distance of these routes as well as the estimated time to complete these routes. 

Next steps in the application include properly tracking the users location throughout the travel and the setup of proper databases that would be able to accessed and manipulated by multiple devices. 

Bellow shows the main screens of the application and the normal use case.
